# Selenium_browserstack_assessment
In this assessment i have used Python as my primary scripting language along with selenium package to complete the tasks given.
Instead of directly using Google Trasnslation API i have used a python package(pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0) that is linked to the api in backend.
