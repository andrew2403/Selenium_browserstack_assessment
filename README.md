# Selenium_browserstack_assessment
Pre-requisite :
ChromeDriver as per the system version
Python3
Packages mentioned in the script

In this assessment i have used Python as my primary scripting language along with selenium package to complete the tasks given.

Instead of directly using Google Trasnslation API i have used a python package(pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0) that is linked to the api in backend. 

Although the code is debugged sometimes the code is going to work in peculiar ways due to unexpected popups that might not be handled proactively. Please try running the code one more time the code may work fine.
